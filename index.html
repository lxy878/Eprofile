    <h1>Welcome to My Home Page</h1>
    <div class="context">
      Please be informed that I am willing to relocate to another city for the job offer. <br><br>
      My name is Xiaoyi Liu.  I am a recent graduate in Computer Science degree
      from Queens College of The City University of New York.
      Now, I am seeking a position as a software engineer. <br><br>
      During academic years, I accomplished a variety of projects in different programming
      languages.  C++ was the first programming languages I learned and the fundamental of all languages I have learned so far. Starting from my junior year, Java becomes my prime programming language to build most of my projects such as Classification and Regression Trees, Craigslist_App, etc.  Also, I obtained some experience with SQL language from
      Database course and some experience with front-end web design from Internet and Web Technologies course.<br><br>
      Furthermore, I had some experiences with other languages by learning from some online courses.  I had built several personal projects such as a game by using Unity Engine (C#), applications by Android Studio (Java), a functional google-like search engine by using HTML/CSS, MySql and Nodejs packages, etc.
      <br><br>
      The best projects I had completed:<br><br>
